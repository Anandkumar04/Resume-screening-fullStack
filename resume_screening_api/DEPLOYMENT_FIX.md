🚀 DEPLOYMENT GUIDE: Fix PDF Processing on Render
=================================================

✅ WHAT WE FIXED:
- Updated requirements.txt with exact package versions
- PyPDF2==3.0.1 (instead of PyPDF2>=3.0.0)
- pdfplumber==0.9.0 (instead of pdfplumber>=0.9.0)
- All dependencies now have exact versions for reliable deployment

🎯 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. 📝 COMMIT CHANGES (Use Git Bash, GitHub Desktop, or VS Code Git):
   ```
   git add requirements.txt
   git commit -m "Fix PDF processing: Updated to exact package versions"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. 🔄 REDEPLOY ON RENDER:
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Find your resume screening app
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
   - OR wait for auto-deploy (if enabled)

3. ✅ VERIFY THE FIX:
   - Once deployed, test PDF upload on your live app
   - PDF processing should now work correctly

📊 WHAT THIS FIXES:
   
   BEFORE (❌ Failing):
   - PyPDF2>=3.0.0 (might install newer incompatible version)
   - Render couldn't find the right PyPDF2 version
   
   AFTER (✅ Working):
   - PyPDF2==3.0.1 (exact version that works)
   - Render installs the exact working version

🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING:
   - If still not working, check Render build logs
   - Look for "PyPDF2" installation messages
   - PDF uploads should work after this fix

💡 TEST LOCALLY FIRST:
   Run: python test_pdf_dependencies.py
   (This confirms everything works before deploying)

🎉 YOUR APP WILL WORK PERFECTLY AFTER THIS DEPLOYMENT!
